# Costa Rican Household Poverty Prediction

### Objective

Many social programs have a hard time making sure the right people are given enough aid. It’s especially tricky when a program focuses on the poorest segment of the population. The world’s poorest typically can’t provide the necessary income and expense records to prove that they qualify.
The objective is to establish new algorithms which correctly identifies economic conditions of a household so that proper resources are made available to them. Dataset used for this problem contains Costa Rican household characteristics.

### Problem Description

This is a supervised multi-class classification machine learning problem:

1. *Supervised*: provided with the labels for the training data
2. *Multi-class classification*: Labels are discrete values with 4 classes
